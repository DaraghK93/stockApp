# Team 1 - Feel the MERN
# Sprint Retrospective - Week 3 
# Date - 07/10/2022


## **Start - Things we need to start doing:**
- Need to split out the dependencies so that we're tripping each other up when it comes to features and PRs.
- More close communication with specific teams at early stages:
  - For frontend - Need more prototypes for explaining our ideas, more casual and quick prototypes to get our ideas across to each other.
  - For backend - Need identify clearly what information is needed when creating routes between frontend and backend.
- Create spreadsheet of routes for both teams
  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - If something needs to be calculated, provide overview of what the function needs to do.
- Need to create a rule for branch/issue naming, everyone should follow this.
- If in doubt as to whether you should be in a meeting, ask the question.


## **Stop - Things we need to stop doing:**
- Tying in with need to stop multiple people working on interrelated features, this slows down development work.
- Need to stop working on multiple features on a branch without committing, commit early and often.
- Wasting too much time on blockers before asking the team. Give it maybe 45 mins - 1 hour of research on your own, but don't be afraid to ask the team in case they can point you in the right direction.


## **Continue - Things we need to continue doing:**
- Overall good PRs so far. Keep it up comitting early and often.
- Good and useful comments on the PRs. Keep this going.
- Good communication as a whole. Discord is an extremely useful resoruce for keeping in contact.
- Continue with frequency/length of meetings. We're avoiding unnecessary/overly long meetings.
