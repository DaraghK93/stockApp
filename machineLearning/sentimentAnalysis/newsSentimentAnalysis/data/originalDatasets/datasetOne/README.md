This dataset was obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurzing/aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-for-financial-news)

## Kaggle Description 
Fine-grained financial sentiment analysis on news headlines is a challenging task requiring human-annotated datasets to achieve high performance. Limited studies have tried to address the sentiment extraction task in a setting where multiple entities are present in a news headline. In an effort to further research in this area, we make publicly available SEntFiN 1.0, a human-annotated dataset of 10,700+ news headlines with entity-sentiment annotations, of which 2,800+ headlines contain multiple entities, often with conflicting sentiments.

## Features 
1. ***S No.*** - A unique serial number for the record.
2. ***Title*** - A financial headline. 
3. ***Decisions*** - Dictionary where the key is the finacial entity and the value is the sentiment. 
4. ***Words*** - The number of words in the news headline.
