# Model 4
The big change within this model is using the words list fund by Calon avaiable at  https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/ for the word ocunt instead of generating it witin the script. 

Unfortuntely the results have trended down in percentage compared to previous models for the training dataset. However possibly altering the training/test split may solve this. 

The words are more general negative, positive and neutral words.
