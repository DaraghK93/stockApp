This directory holds 2 files. One is the Jupyter notebook that was used to carry out the initial EDA and exploration and the other is that Jupyter notebook converted to a Python file.
For best results, use the Jupyter notebook file as it's much easier to run individual cells and to be able to scroll through all the plots.
The Python script functions the same, however it's not as easy to see all the plots and dataframes etc.
