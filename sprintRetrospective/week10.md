# Team 1 - Feel the MERN
# Sprint Retrospective - Week 10
# Date - 25/11/2022


## **Start - Things we need to start doing:**
- Start showing the work we've done on the application. Right now the components of the site are not clearly visible to users. Need to create a splashpage for this to educate new users on what this application is.
- Ask the team is something worth starting
- Send message to lecturers when we have a feature done that we'd like feedback on


## **Stop - Things we need to stop doing:**
- Again, this carries over from last week. Stop putting off the diary.


## **Continue - Things we need to continue doing:**
- Prioritise features and issues over the last 2 weeks
- Continue to gamify the application
- Continue spreading the PRs. Shout if you have scope
- Linking backend and frontend development (make sure both ends know the plan and direction).
- Filling out API routes in spreadsheet.



## **Actions - Things we will be doing:**
- Scrum master role changeout - Joey out, Warren in.
- Email lecturers regarding new features
  - Outline new features
  - Ask for UI feedback Gestalt and Nielsen's
  - Include feedback sheet for Andrea's class
  - Survey for the class
  - Inform them the old accounts have been deleted
- Plan UI evaluation modifications based on the UI feedback

### **Presentation Feedback:**
- Damian loves the game screen prototype.
  - "Add flames and stuff".
  - Make it as cartoony as possible.
  - Paul is not very keen with this style.
- Warren's Create Game Screens (Damian):
  - Trading Fees slider:
    - This is very counter intuitive.
    - The fact that the "velocity" of it is the opposite to the other sliders. i.e. for the others, increasing slider is better for the user, whereas as you increase the trading fees it's negative for the user.
  - Select sectors:
    - Sectors should be deselected by default i.e. opposite of how it's done currently.
- Discovery Page (Andrea):
  - Cards shouldn't be cut off on the right. Andrea didn't like this.
    - Maybe put an arrow on the right to help users see that they can scroll horizontally.
    - Maybe colour the background of the cards (could take average colour of the image and find complementary colour for background).
- Accessibility (Damian):
  - Balance between fun/boring(professional) look.
- Damian really really liked our visualisations, all the diagrams etc.
- AWS Lambda - We should submit an appendix to the report with a Lambda "Quick start" guide.
- Send lecturers a link to new changes when they're ready. Maybe when the idividual game screen is ready?
- Splash page - Need this ASAP. Andrea needs this!
- Google Chrome user manual - Comic strip:
  - This worked extremely well for explaining what it is and what it does. Look into this.
