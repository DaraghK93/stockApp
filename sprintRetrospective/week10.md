## **Start - Things we need to start doing:**
- Start showing the work we've done on the application. Right now the components of the site are not clearly visible to users. Need to create a splashpage for this to educate new users on what this application is.
- Ask the team is something worth starting
- Send message to lecturers when we have a feature done that we'd like feedback on

- Again, this carries over from last week. Stop putting off the diary.


## **Continue - Things we need to continue doing:**
- Prioritise features and issues over the last 2 weeks
