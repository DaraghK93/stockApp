# Team 1 - Feel the MERN
# Sprint Retrospective - Week 9
# Date - 18/11/2022


## **Start - Things we need to start doing:**
- Start showing the work we've done on the application. Right now the components of the site are not clearly visible to users. Need to create a splashpage for this to educate new users on what this application is.
  - An unlisted YT video might also work for this? Or specifically for the game?
- Prioritising features/issues, we only have 3 weeks of development left and the end is very rapidly approaching. Need to be smart about how we spend our time.

## **Stop - Things we need to stop doing:**
- Again, this carries over from last week. Need to stop putting off the diary.
- Again, this carries over from last week. Stop leaving PRs until Thursday.

## **Continue - Things we need to continue doing:**
- Breaking up PRs into smaller chunks.
- Pruning PRs.

- Filling out API routes in spreadsheet
