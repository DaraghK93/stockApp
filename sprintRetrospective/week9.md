# Team 1 - Feel the MERN
# Sprint Retrospective - Week 9
# Date - 18/11/2022


## **Start - Things we need to start doing:**

  - An unlisted YT video might also work for this? Or specifically for the game?
- Prioritising features/issues, we only have 3 weeks of development left and the end is very rapidly approaching. Need to be smart about how we spend our time.
- Start considering gamification as a core compoenent of the development of this application.
- Start Consulting Damian on UI/Accessibility:
  - Accessibility.
  - Gestalt Principles.
