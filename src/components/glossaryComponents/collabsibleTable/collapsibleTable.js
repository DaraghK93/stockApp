              This is the current value of one unit of a stock. The price of a stock can change due to
              various market forces. <br/><br/>
              These market forces include supply and demand. If the demand for a stock increases, and fewer
              people wish to sell, decreasing the supply, then the price of the stock will increase. Investors 
              often base their decisions on positive and negative news sentiment. <br/><br/>

            <Accordion.Body>
              ESG stands for <b>Environmental</b>, <b>Social</b> and <b>Governance</b>. These are a set of standards 
              for each company's behaviour. These ratings are designed to help investors to invest
              in a socially conscious way. A good ESG rating means a company is managing its environment, social, and 
              governance risks well relative to its peers. A poor ESG rating is the opposite - - the company has 
              relatively higher unmanaged exposure to ESG risks. <br/><br/>
